## 🚀 Featured Projects

### AI vs Real Image Classifier (NEW)
- Problem: AI image generators (Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, DALL·E) produce hyper-realistic visuals that can be hard to distinguish from real images — a key challenge for moderation, research integrity, and content platforms.
- Dataset: ~1,000 images → 500 AI-generated (Stable Diffusion) vs 470 real photos (Pexels API).
- Preprocessing: Resized to 224×224, normalized, augmentations (flips, rotations, brightness/contrast, Gaussian blur).
- Model: Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained on ImageNet (transfer learning). Trained on Roboflow GPU cluster. (~34 min, 12 epochs).
- Performance: 99% Test Accuracy with smooth convergence & validation stability.
- Deployment: Streamlit App → Live Demo(https://ziadaivsreal.streamlit.app/), Roboflow API for hosted inference
- Interactive workflow: image upload → classifier prediction → real-time confidence score.

### 🏠 Energy Efficiency Explorer  
- Compared **real vs synthetic datasets** (UCI + Mostly AI)  
- Built XGBoost and Random Forest models → **R²: 0.99 (real) vs 0.82 (synthetic)**  
- Applied **SHAP interpretability** to reveal building design drivers (Compactness, Glazing)  
- Delivered an **interactive Streamlit app** 👉 [Live Demo](https://ziadenergyproject.streamlit.app/)
